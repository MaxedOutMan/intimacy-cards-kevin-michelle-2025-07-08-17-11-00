Materials: Education first, partner presence mandatory, safety protocols. How to: NEVER attempt alone - death risk real. Partner controls all breath restriction. Use hands on sides of neck, not windpipe. Few seconds maximum. Watch for face color changes. Tap-out signal essential. Creates intense sensations from oxygen restriction. Many prefer simulated choking. Safety: Leading cause of sexual death, never use ropes/bags, CPR knowledge required. Progression: Breath holding, controlled pressure, verbal simulation.</p></div><div class="card-tips"><strong>💡 Tips:</strong> Only attempt when fully aroused and trusting life literally. Aftercare is essential - plan breathing exercises and monitoring after.</div></div></div><div class="card-item" data-intensity="Warming" data-type="Experience" data-search="the body language reading exercise"><div class="card-header" style="background: #AF7AC5"><span class="card-type-label">✨ ADVENTURE</span><span class="card-intensity">🔥 Building Heat</span></div><div class="card-body"><h3 class="card-question">The Body Language Reading Exercise</h3><div class="card-instructions"><h4>How to Experience This Adventure</h4><p>The Body Language Reading Exercise. Materials: Comfortable space, 20 minutes uninterrupted time. How to: Sit facing each other. Partner A expresses different emotions/desires through body language only - no words. Partner B interprets and checks accuracy. Switch roles. Focus on subtle cues: breathing changes, muscle tension, eye dilation. Safety: Respect discovered triggers. Progression: Practice during daily life to improve intuitive connection.</p></div><div class="card-tips"><strong>💡 Tips:</strong> Build anticipation throughout the day by practicing subtle signals.
